# SentimentNet
Deep neural network for sentiment analysis on Twitter data.
WIP NOTHING WORKS YET
1) Download datasetes from http://help.sentiment140.com/for-students/
2) Create new directory named data
3) Place files training.1600000.processed.noemoticon.csv and testdata.manual.2009.06.14.csv in data/ directory

Files in model directory are heavily WIP and don't make any sense whatsoever.
