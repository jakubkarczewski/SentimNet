Signing off now. That was more than enough Twitter trouble for one morning!
RT @SteveCase: I agree: https://t.co/mimefUL5ho https://t.co/PKfAyB1QTx
@qriosity_ @MacTechGenius No rare earth metals in battery
@camdtor @trylks Almost ready
@MacTechGenius App update is about two weeks out. Linux kernel and browser update probably a month or so. HW2 Autopilot has priority.
"@FredericLambert Yes, but Model 3 is the overwhelming priority"
@clay_ellis I will post an article he wrote half a century ago about flying through Africa and Asia in his plane. One of my favorite things.
@christesla @FredericLambert Almost there. We are just being very careful with the rollout.
@trylks A lot of terrible things could happen in four years of extremism. Do you really want another war? That's where extremism leads.
"@FredericLambert Yeah, it is hard to convey complex ideas in 140 chars and tone is lost in text"
@CycleTrades @rtoro20 People should push to have as many moderates advising the President as possible. Blind hate is never the right answer.
@Wise1919 @FredericLambert Rolling out a new update today.
@recipher We should try our best
"@iamDeveloper Really? Ok, I will work harder on thinking first and tweeting second. Sorry for anything thoughtless."
@martinengwicht @FredericLambert I just had three coffees :)
@thelogicbox @IanrossWins Mars is critical for the long-term survival of humanity and life on Earth as we know it
@seanbroswag @FredericLambert Numeric
@B0Turner Gravimetric energy density of batteries and achieving a high cell mass fraction
"@Travelingmom23 I love Canada! I'm half Canadian. My Mom was born in Regina. My grandfather (her Dad) was American, born in Minnesota."
@FredericLambert Me too. I hope to get back to regularly scheduled programming soon ...
"@brendangage I agree, great country! Looking forward to taking my kids for a visit. I've heard it is incredibly beautiful."
@rtoro20 Really? I already have both feet in my mouth and am levitating on my own idiocy...
@DaringKid True. Me being one of them :)
"@marcelsalathe Not perfect &amp; cd be better, but 10th out of 200+ countries with only a 0.08 diff to ""1st"" place means it's essentially on par"
"@andresantoniop Fair point, sorry"
"Activists should be pushing for more moderates to advise President, not fewer. How could having only extremists advise him possibly be good?"
@RealPhillipPoon Needs a major overhaul
@BenCam137 @FifthRocket Exactly
@AanstadGard Norway is great on all levels. Love Norway!
@BullFlags Yeah. And Twitter is a hater Hellscape.
"@W4AS Good grief, I'm not ""working"" for Trump. I'm trying to provide advice that helps take things in a more positive direction."
"@BitterMercy @CallumK24 Actually, I think it's kinda cool :)"
@EricHaegler @iLexomat Isn't that basically like having a jury of peers? That is a default option in the US.
"@vladsavov Those countries have strong justice systems, but I'd put them roughly on par with US. That rating system conflates many factors."
@FifthRocket Did you read my tweets? I attacked it hard. Did not defend.
@KENEMONICS You're right. Politics is a no-win situation. Somebody is going to hate what you say no matter what that is.
@martinengwicht Also good. There are several that are on par with US. Just don't think any are better. People confuse laws with courts.
@paulvankeep Mostly anti-drug laws
@zgiarrizzo Exactly
"@TheLAAdams The laws need to change. Judges are responsible for evaluating whether an action breaks the law, not making law."
@humplik The remedy for that is changing the law
"@CallumK24 Ok, but what's up the wigs?"
@iLexomat There are many good legal systems on par with US. Just don't know any that are better.
@Biesseman True!
"Many in America don't realize how proud they should be of the legal system. Not perfect, but nowhere is the cause of justice better served."
"RT @TeslaMotors: Honored to receive Best Car Award for the third year in a row in Germany. Thank you to all 124,000 of you who voted! httpsâ€¦"
