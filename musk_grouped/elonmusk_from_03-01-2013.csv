Would also like to thank @USAirForce for allowing us to use their long range comm system for Dragon in free drift.
Just want to say thanks to @NASA for being the world's coolest customer. Looking forward to delivering the goods!
Orbit raising burn successful. Dragon back on track.
Thruster pods one through four are now operating nominally. Preparing to raise orbit. All systems green.
Pods 1 and 4 now online and thrusters engaged. Dragon transitioned from free drift to active control. Yes!!
Attempting bring up of thruster pods 2 and 4
