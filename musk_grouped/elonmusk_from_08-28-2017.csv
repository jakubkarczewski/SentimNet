"To be clear, a Hyperloop passenger version wouldn't have intense light strobe effect (just for testing), nor uncomfortable acceleration"

Will run the SpaceX pusher sled later this week and see what it can do

"@PiPrefer Yes, it is"
@JRoque250 @Freewill404 @cbotnyse A tiny one
"Btw, high accel only needed because tube is short. For passenger transport, this can be spread over 20+ miles, so no spilt drinks."
"@Freewill404 @cbotnyse No such thing as true vacuum, so actually yes"
@cbotnyse Call it ~800mph
"Might be possible to go supersonic in our test Hyperloop tube, even though it's only 0.8 miles long. Very high accel/decel needed …"
"Congratulations to WARR team from Tech Univ Munich for winning 2nd @Hyperloop competition! Peak speed of 324 km/h, which is over 200 mph!!"
