Will post video next week of designing a rocket part with hand gestures &amp; then immediately printing it in titanium
"And, uhh no (zillionth person who asked), I am not going to make an IM suit, however design by hand-manipulated hologram is actually useful."
@brynmooser Reality is the best illusion
We figured out how to design rocket parts just w hand movements through the air (seriously). Now need a high frame rate holograph generator.
