Launch can be viewed live from Cape causeways or via http://t.co/soOCggCpN0 webcast around 5:30 local time on Monday
@DarkSapiens Easier to make the plane change to equatorial orbit. Done in order to reduce satellite side delta V from 1800 m/s to 1500 m/s.
"Will be toughest mission to date. Requires coast + upper stage restart + going to 80,000 km altitude (~1/4 way to moon)."
Headed to Cape Canaveral tomorrow for first @SpaceX geostationary satellite launch.
