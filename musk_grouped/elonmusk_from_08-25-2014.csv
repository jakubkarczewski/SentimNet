@evanwiththebig @TeslaMotors Expansion to Madrid already underway. Map is being updated. All of Spain &amp; Portugal by end of 2015.
Model S limits torque if brake &amp; accel simul pressed. Going to zero torque with brake press would be a safety hazard.
@cermak @Tesla_Europe I agree. We are fixing this plan. Updated map coming soon.
@WillOremus That has been my goal from the beginning. Need the Gigafactory for Model 3.
