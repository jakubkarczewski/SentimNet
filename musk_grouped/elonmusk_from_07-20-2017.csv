"@mariom An underground Hyperloop would mean no disruption above ground and be way faster, so I think it is he right way to go"
@ejohnson99 City of Chicago already approached us about doing a high speed tunnel from O'Hare to downtown. They've been great.
"If you want this to happen fast, please let your local &amp; federal elected representatives know. Makes a big difference if they hear from you."
"Still a lot of work needed to receive formal approval, but am optimistic that will occur rapidly"
@curiousworlds For sure. First set of tunnels are to alleviate greater LA urban congestion. Will start NY-DC in parâ€¦ https://t.co/N3iENcAtdh
@DaveLeeBBC Support would be much appreciated!
"City center to city center in each case, with up to a dozen or more entry/exit elevators in each city"
Just received verbal govt approval for The Boring Company to build an underground NY-Phil-Balt-DC Hyperloop. NY-DC in 29 mins.
