@nickg_uk already taken care of
Kinda. Creating a seamlessly integrated Tesla battery &amp; solar power product that looks beautiful is the reason https://t.co/4z6MzBB9p2
@SwiftOnSecurity I like your tweets!
"@SwiftOnSecurity Tricky in 140 chars, but: 1B needed for min statistical sample size. More software mods and data may be needed beyond that."
Blog on Autopilot by @PeterDiamandis https://t.co/LR5zuw3J9X
@bolayer @SwiftOnSecurity US is ~11 deaths per billion miles. WW is 17 deaths per billion. Autopilot already much better than either so far.
@c4757p @SwiftOnSecurity Unless we get there and find it isn't enough. Just won't be before 1B.
"@FantaAIex It is extensively tested in the lab and in the Tesla test fleet. However, there is no substitute for real world experience."
"@SwiftOnSecurity With less than 1B miles, there simply isn't enough data. 1B is a necessary but not necessarily sufficient condition."
"@nicatronTg @SwiftOnSecurity Thanks. Point of calling it ""beta"" was to emphasize to those who chose to use it that it wasn't perfect."
@_CraigR @FortuneMagazine exactly
"@wfederman @stegen @FortuneMagazine that wasn't criticism, just clarification"
@SwiftOnSecurity why?
@wfederman @stegen @FortuneMagazine thought I was posting Reuters. Copied the wrong link.
@vicentes Probably six months. Will include hundreds of refinements to handle rare corner cases in Autopilot.
"@stegen @FortuneMagazine you're right, no point"
"@chirag Use of word ""beta"" is explicitly so that drivers don't get comfortable. It is not beta software in the standard sense."
"Misunderstanding of what ""beta"" means to Tesla for Autopilot: any system w less than 1B miles of real world driving

Today is Nikola Tesla's birthday. I hope he likes what we've done in his name.
"Working on Top Secret Tesla Masterplan, Part 2. Hoping to publish later this week."
