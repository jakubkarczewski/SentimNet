We called manual abort. Better to be paranoid and wrong. Bringing rocket down to borescope engines ...
"If launch aborts, we will bring the rocket down for engine inspection, so probably a few days before next attempt"
"Increasing helium spin start pressure. Probably &lt;50% chance of passing all aborts, but worth a try. Countdown resuming ..."
Launch aborted by autosequence due to slower than expected thrust ramp. Seems ok on closer inspection. Cycling countdown.

"...but only if you like your house ""Honda recalls Fit for fire risk, says park it outside http://t.co/tLpZ7HBIdV """
