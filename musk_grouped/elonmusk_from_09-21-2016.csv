@thefrownyface @massossltd I read a story about a father whose son died incredibly quickly. Can be as little as half an hour in hot sun.
@RoyArne83 currently stops at 20% state of charge. This number will be configurable.
"@ninjas ""smart"" preconditioning should be less dumb in 8.0"
"@notch also, the Tesla is poison free!"
@massossltd all cars
@Scott_Helme can't always detect babies and pets
Can be turned on or off. V8.1 will allow always-on min and max temps to be set.
Tesla keeps temp below 40C/105F by automatically venting cabin &amp; turning on AC when needed. Can do this for up to a year on a full charge.
My favorite new feature is the always-on max temp control for keeping kids and pets safe from overheating.
This is a major overhaul on almost every level compared to V7.
"V8.0 starts downloading tonight. Release will be gradual to make sure there aren't small regressions. Many car configs, many environments."
