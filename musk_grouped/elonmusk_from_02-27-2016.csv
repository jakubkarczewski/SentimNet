"@derekslager @skiesforme yes, it actually performed better than other colors on stain tests. Best not to have vented seats w kids though."
"@skiesforme Can't emphasize enough that white is the best interior. Also, pick 6 seats unless you really need 7."
"@skiesforme @TeslaMotors That said, the white interior is the best. Highly recommend."
@skiesforme Heavy use of the white causes splitting. Adding backing material to strengthen. Will be upgraded at no cost.
