@John_Gardi Using legs as air brakes to drop terminal velocity in half requires slight redesign &amp; more data. Maybe flight 21.
"Grid fins are stowed on ascent and then deploy on reentry for ""x-wing"" style control. Each fin moves independently for pitch/yaw/roll."
"Base is 300 ft by 100 ft, with wings that extend width to 170 ft. Will allow refuel &amp; rocket flyback in future."
Testing operation of hypersonic grid fins (x-wing config) going on next flight http://t.co/O1tMSIXxsT
