"@abadcliche Most likely true, but we can't yet find it on any vehicle sensors"
Will get back to Autopilot update blog tomorrow.

Particularly trying to understand the quieter bang sound a few seconds before the fireball goes off. May come from rocket or something else.

Important to note that this happened during a routine filling operation. Engines were not on and there was no apparent heat source.
Still working on the Falcon fireball investigation. Turning out to be the most difficult and complex failure we have ever had in 14 years.
