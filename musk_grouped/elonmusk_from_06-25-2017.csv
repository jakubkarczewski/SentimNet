New titanium grid fins worked even better than expected. Should be capable of an indefinite number of flights with no service.
@mjmdavis Still humans
@TheCocoaNaut Significantly improves control force
Launch at 1:25 delivering 10 satellites for Iridium. Droneship repositioned due to extreme weather. Will be tight. https://t.co/6ZcSG29B74
