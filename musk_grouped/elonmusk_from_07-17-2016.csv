"Tesla customers are v smart &amp; don't want media speaking on their behalf abt Autopilot. Recent poll: 0.0% want it disabled -- not 0.1%, 0.0%."
"@heroineworshipe @BoschGlobal It can at moderate range, but our ultrasonics are very good at human (or anything &gt;= water density) detection"
@MacTechGenius Improved fan speed algorithm coming soon. Doesn't need to be so loud.
Great rebuttal by a Tesla owner to those calling for Autopilot to be disabled. Was written with zero input from us. https://t.co/Kfg1ewKoCZ
@Tyler_K_Berg That is a very good point!
Have to focus on tonight's @SpaceX launch. Will post Tesla (master) product plan afterwards.
"Btw, want to thank both Bosch and MobilEye for their help and support in making Autopilot better. Please direct all criticism at Tesla."
"Promising call today with @BoschGlobal, maker of our radar sensor. Looks like significant improvements possible via OTA software update."
@Mikey67Tang much appreciated
@reddersla Usually true. We need more sane and reasonable people making their voice heard.
Sensible article on Autopilot by @the guardian https://t.co/BbvXaNI4Xk
"RT @SpaceX: All systems go &amp; weather 90% favorable for launch of Dragon to @Space_Station. Liftoff slated for Monday, 12:45am ET https://t.â€¦"
