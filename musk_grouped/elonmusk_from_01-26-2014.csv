"RT @plugshare: Congratulations to John and Jill, first to drive across US using only free @TeslaMotors Superchargers! http://t.co/hA6YlkyjzN"
"Two teams from Tesla aiming to set a cross-country EV speed record this week. Departing Fri from LA, arriving Sun in NY."
Will be doing the LA-NY family road trip over Spring Break. Made everyone watch National Lampoon's Vacation as prep.
"Tesla Supercharger network now energized from New York to LA, both coast + Texas! Approx 80% of US population covered."
