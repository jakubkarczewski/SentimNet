@D1sneyNut Yes
@nickbaum I believe so
@nddugan Yup
@Mr_Ewe_Guy Oh so little faith
@kryniog The shorter wheelbase only allows for a 75 kWh pack in Model 3 at current cell/module energy densities

@FredericLambert It still has one display
RT @danieltadros: @bobbykansara @elonmusk @MrThorman My model S is the best car I've ever had !!
@VoltzCoreAudio Nothing majorly new that a consumer would notice. Lots of new tech in the design and production process though.

"Model 3 was going to be called Model E, for obvious dumb humor reasons, but Ford sued to block it, so now it is S3X. Totally different :)"
@TimBeiko Yes
"Model 3 is just a smaller, more affordable version of Model S w less range &amp; power &amp; fewer features. Model S has more advanced technology."
"Am noticing that many people think Model 3 is the ""next version"" of a Tesla, like iPhone 2 vs 3. This is not true."
