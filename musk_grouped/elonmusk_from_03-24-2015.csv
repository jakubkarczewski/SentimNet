"Right move is try both tunnels and flying cars. Otherwise, having 2D streets and 3D buildings means bad traffic forever."
"Reasons I like tunnels: you still travel in 3D fast, but immune to weather, quiet and no risk cars fall on your head"
"Flying car pros: travel in 3D fast. Cons: risk of car falling on head much greater, noisy, grounded in bad weather"
"Contrary to press reports, I'm not against flying cars. Just said it was important to consider both pros and cons."
