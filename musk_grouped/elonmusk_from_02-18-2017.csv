@Xuan_Thai System was green for launch. I called it off.
"@spacecom They are often right, but, in this case, we have already retired so much R&amp;D risk on Dragon 2, that I feel very confident of 2018."
"@zperrin99 Uses high pressure bleed off the fuel side (RP-1 kerosene) turbopump, so no dedicated pump or fluid needed"
"Btw, 99% likely to be fine (closed loop TVC wd overcome error), but that 1% chance isn't worth rolling the dice. Better to wait a day."
"@Zybbby Not obviously related to the (very tiny) helium leak, but also not out of the question"
"If this is the only issue, flight would be fine, but need to make sure that it isn't symptomatic of a more significant upstream root cause"
"All systems go, except the movement trace of an upper stage engine steering hydraulic piston was slightly odd. Standing down to investigate."

Looks like we are go for launch. Added an abort trigger at T-60 secs for pressure decay of upper stage helium spin start system.
