"@alankerlin Hydraulics are usually closed, but that adds mass vs short acting open systems. F9 fins only work for 4 mins. We were ~10% off."
Am super proud of my crew for making huge strides towards reusability on this mission. You guys rock!
"Upcoming flight already has 50% more hydraulic fluid, so should have plenty of margin for landing attempt next month."
"Grid fins worked extremely well from hypersonic velocity to subsonic, but ran out of hydraulic fluid right before landing."
Didn't get good landing/impact video. Pitch dark and foggy. Will piece it together from telemetry and ... actual pieces.
Ship itself is fine. Some of the support equipment on the deck will need to be replaced...
"Rocket made it to drone spaceport ship, but landed hard. Close, but no cigar this time. Bodes well for the future tho."
Ascent phase good. Dragon deployed to Space Station rendezvous orbit.
