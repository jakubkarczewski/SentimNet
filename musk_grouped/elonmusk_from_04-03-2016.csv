"@GonzaloBolio yes, coming this year"
@AmarnathRevanna Air suspension dynamically adjusts ride height
@GatorWass you can do that now with S and X. Will be same for 3.
@_elombardo @rjpryan correct
@EduardoForneck hopefully 0.21
@PeteEhmKay @gerardomarina what's the link to that?
"@tapwin No, but we will need to build a factory in Europe to serve long-term regional demand as Fremont reaches max capacity."
@mpatfield no problem
@CrackedUpCorson Will cover whole country hopefully this year
"@AndersRytter yes, but production AWD will be a lot faster"
@AlexBelohlavek less
@torvos torque is shifted between front &amp; rear motors every ~.01 secs. Traction control is way better than a normal AWD. Digital vs analog.
"And, of course, it will have more cowbells."
"Model 3 will be RWD, with dual motor AWD optional. Even RWD will have great traction on ice due to fast torque response of Tesla drivetrain."
@GolfsHard yes
@Zooropa88 @TeslaMotors Superchargers and service centers will cover all of Italy later this year
@_Only_Hawk @MICHAELSD01 @TechGrlTweeter definitely
@Alandbru @TeslaMotors should be addressed this year
@CmaxVs Only way to get enough rear passenger headroom was to move the rear roof cross-car support beam. A bike will still fit no problem.
@iKrivetko that's not the real steering system
@B_Rans yes. Will easily fit two child seats. Three if you buy slim seats.
@gerardomarina Some tweaking underway
@HBL_Cosmin Wait until you see the real steering controls and system for the 3. It feels like a spaceship.
@MICHAELSD01 @TechGrlTweeter Won't happen. Reason initial cars are delivered close to factory is to have rapid turnaround on early issues.
@scottkelley99 Edge and contour refinement are ongoing. Even .1mm matters.
@_amwolo_ They can. Will be great for road trips and camping
@BValvsRacing It will make sense after part 2 of the Model 3 unveil
"A Model 3 order gives you priority in your geography, so, even tho total count is high, ordering early will make a big difference locally."
"In general, product comments, suggestions and criticisms are always welcome"
@RyanCasburn We always try to maximize customer happiness even if that means a revenue shortfall in a quarter. Loyalty begets loyalty.
@SnoozeThroughF1 There will be an optional tow hitch.
@RGspan Our production ramp plan should enable large numbers of non X/S customers to receive the credit.
@jeffrey @neutyp Matte black was surprisingly popular. Probably makes sense to bring it to production.
"@WaltNew cool, thanks!"
"@mindthreat @RyanHummer Yes, if the trend continues, before"
276k Model 3 orders by end of Sat
