Would seem to indicate that one or more people sought to create the false impression of a safety issue where none existed. Q is why?
"Of greater concern: 37 of 40 suspension complaints to NHTSA were fraudulent, i.e. false location or vehicle identification numbers were used"
NHTSA confirmed today that they found no safety concern with the Model S suspension and have no further need for data from us on this matter
