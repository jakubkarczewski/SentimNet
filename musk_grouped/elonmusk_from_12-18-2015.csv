Rounding up to 1 sec for a bit of timing margin. Updating flight computer command sequence â€¦
Aborted on ignition timing due to slow ground side valve. Adjusting ignition sequence by 0.6 secs for next attempt.
About 2 mins from static fire
@elonmusk holding for issue resolution
Abort triggered by flight computer on upper stage throttle valve. Adjusting thresholds and restarting count at T-10 mins.
5 mins from static fire test
"@lukealization yes, from 70F to 20 F"
@craigcocca It worked in Texas
@PaigeANjax -340 F in this case. Deep cryo increases density and amplifies rocket performance. First time anyone has gone this low for O2.
Falcon 9 is vertical on the launch pad at Cape Canaveral. Working towards static fire. Deep cryo liquid oxygen presenting some challenges.
@mashabletech @mashable Not really my letter (no authorship contribution). Just agreed to add my name when they asked.
