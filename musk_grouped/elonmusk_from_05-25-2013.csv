"Am thinking of doing a movie ""sequel"" of sorts to Thank You for Smoking. That was bad CO2 for indiv, this for the planet"
Worth reading Merchants of Doubt. Same who tried to deny smoking deaths r denying climate change http://t.co/C6H8HrzS8X
"Yeah, climate change should really be considered a centrist issue, as it affects everyone."
"Am not suggesting shutting down CO2 production, but rather to price in environmental cost &amp; shift to sustainable energy"
"Even if the answer is only on the order of 1%, we should still take immediate action, as there is only one atmosphere."
Right question to ask Dyson or others: what is probability that human actions could cause catastrophic climate change?
What most serious scientists have a problem with is the notion of certainty about *any* subject. That is not the point.
@kn0xvi11ain Very few. Scientific consensus at time of Columbus was world was round http://t.co/V3XIcob4s8
"Sorry for all the heavy stuff abt climate change, but I really thought world wd take action sooner. No time for subtlety"
@1stHubbleFan @keithwarren Exactly
"In reality, 97% of scientists agree that we face serious human generated climate change http://t.co/soQCnJB61B"
"Climate change deniers claim ""scientists disagree"", same rebuttal used by tobacco industry about lung cancer for decades"
"Good article on ""Climate Change"" vs ""Global Warming"" referred by @ForrestTanaka http://t.co/D1s4RJ0qus"

"Was beat up pretty badly as a kid &amp; left me w jagged septum. Harder to breathe as I got older, so time to fix."

"Had a minor operation, so am in bed in meds. Probably shouldn't be tweeting :)"
Sign of a good design is that it feels and is much bigger on inside than looks on outside
@CosmicRami Awesome. We really need to promote that fact in the US. A CO2 tax will not cause economy to grind to a halt!
"Would love to do a pickup truck. Something w ultra low cg for sports car handling, dynamic air suspension &amp; mega torque."
"Technically, I ""got rich"" from Zip2 &amp; PayPal w zero govt anything, then put 100% of that into SpaceX, Tesla &amp; SolarCity."
"If consumption is low, then the tax is proportionately low. We should prob not have tax on basic foods &amp; critical meds."
"@ponder68 Carbon produced by a @SpaceX rocket flight is roughly equal to one 747 flight. No, we should not be exempt."
"Net of gas savings, a Tesla is $550 to $600/month with down payment taken care of by tax credits. Maybe less costly then it first seems."
"Yes, am arguing against subsidies and in favor of a tax on the end bad created. Market will then achieve best solution."
"Trees are net consumers of CO2, so technically we would pay them money :)"
Exactly. Seems crazy to risk the CO2 chemical experiment when we have to find another solution anyway.
Big difference between taxing people and taxing purchases (ie consumption). Much better to emphasize the latter.
@MaxMBerger The collective wisdom of the market is usually (not always) better than the smartest govt regulator.
"Me &amp; other private money funded Tesla for first 7 years, got IPO+ govt money for 3, now paid back. Yes, carbon tax would be a better way."
"@grayj_ There should be a constitutional amendment to redo the tax code every ten years, just like we do a census."
"Weight of scientific evidence. Taxes don't ban a purchase, they just increase cost. Am against bans, except in extreme cases."
"Exactly. Better to tax known bad thing and incent desired outcome, instead of subsidizing particular solution paths. Let market decide."
"Perhaps. I am in favor of fair, simple taxes that are neutral on most things, incent good &amp; disincent bad."
"Great article on Tesla-dealer battle by Leilani Munter (@CarbonFreeGirl), who lives in NC http://t.co/pvEmE5pEVN"
