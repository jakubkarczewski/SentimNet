"Hope we're not just the biological boot loader for digital superintelligence. Unfortunately, that is increasingly probable"
"While on the subject of AI risk, Our Final Invention by @jrbarrat is also worth reading"
"@drwave @itsDanielSuarez Yeah, Daemon is a great read"
@IrrelevantGamer @masseffect Mass Effect 2 is one of the best games ever. Also love Saints Row IV.

Guardians of the Galaxy is great. Best line is when Star-Lord says his spaceship looks like a Jackson Pollock painting under black light.
