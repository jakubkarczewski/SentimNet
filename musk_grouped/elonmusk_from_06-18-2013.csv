"Battery pack swap works with all Tesla Model S cars, past and present. It was always there."
"@zatulsky Shai actually got the idea from a visit to Tesla. The idea is obvious (many things allow battery swap), but the technology is not."
"Video of battery pack swap will be posted to the Tesla website around 9:30pm, so those attending will see this first."
Live pack swap demo on Thurs night at 8pm California time at our design studio in Hawthorne. Seeing is believing.
