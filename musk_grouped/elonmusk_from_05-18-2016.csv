"@jlgolson No prob. We care about doing what's fair &amp; just. Don't always get it right, but intent is always there &amp; we make amends when wrong"
"@jlgolson Per the letter, Tesla paid $55/hr for *additional* services, so no."
"@jlgolson Yes, but it is false of Merc News to say that Tesla took advantage of low cost labor. We paid $55/hr. That is unequivocal."
"We still need to make sure that the injured person is taken care of, but less &amp; less of the Merc story appears to be true"
Merc News story about Tesla using $5/hr labor seems to be missing a digit. Tesla actually paid $55/hr. https://t.co/2dTH0ncdKX
