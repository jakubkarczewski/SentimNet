"@ID_AA_Carmack Yep, good points. I hope you get back into space some day!"
"But credit for 1st reusable suborbital rocket goes to X-15 https://t.co/LSb0f8FLJd
And Burt Rutan for commercial

Jeff maybe unaware SpaceX suborbital VTOL flight began 2013. Orbital water landing 2014. Orbital land landing next. https://t.co/S6WMRnEFY5
"@JeffBezos Not quite ""rarest"". SpaceX Grasshopper rocket did 6 suborbital flights 3 years ago &amp; is still around. https://t.co/6j9ERKCNZl"
@TobiasVdb The F9 booster can reach low orbit as a single stage if not carrying the upper stage and a heavy satellite.
"Getting to space needs ~Mach 3, but GTO orbit requires ~Mach 30. The energy needed is the square, i.e. 9 units for space and 900 for orbit."
"It is, however, important to clear up the difference between ""space"" and ""orbit"", as described well by https://t.co/7PD42m37fZ"
Congrats to Jeff Bezos and the BO team for achieving VTOL on their booster
